# CS335 Final Project
## Members 
- Jacob

## Game Ideas
This section will describe some of the gameplay mechanics, themes, or other main ideas for the project. E.g.
- Scifi Space Shooter - Pilot a ship with paralax scrolling
- Spheggeti Western Horse Riding with an Overhead Perspective like Legend of Zelda

We can each forumlate a single gameplay mechanic or general theme and vote. The mechanic and/or theme with the majority votes can be the chosen idea for the project

## Technology Used

The majority of the group members come from a background of Java Development. Both Jacob and Keith have developed games in Java as well as the game framework, Libgdx. By choosing tools and technologies we are more experienced in, we will be able build prototypes faster and adhere to the quick turnaround/time-to-market that the software develpment industry has adapted in today's time. 

## LibGDX
 The game will be developed using the LibGDX framework. Some of the features of LibGDX include

- OpenGL, LibGDX uses OpenGL ES 2.0 as its shader languages
- Box2D for physics calculations / collision detecting
- Gradle for builds/compiling

## Thoughts on development process
From personal findings and research of current job postings for software engineers, I've found that most companies use the Agile methodology for their development process model. I'd be interested in learning how to build a project the Agile way

## Branches, TDD/BDD, Continous Integration
For our workflow I believe we should use the current development practices to better our chances of landing an initial job in the software development field.
 - Test Driven Development(TDD) - Write test cases for functions PRIOR to writing the actual function. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development
 - Behavior-driven development - Is an augmentation of TDD and adds a few more restrictions to writing tests http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/bdd.html
- Git Branches - Seperate branches should be initialized by each team member.
- Continious Integration(CI) - A CI is like a gate-keeper whom passes or fails a current build based on whether or not all unit tests have passed. LibGDX comes with Jenkins CI and could help us prevent Git merge conflicts / bringing in buggy code, etc
- Use GitHub's bug reporting system
    -Example, [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&product=&content=css&comments=0] 


### Todos

-   Agree upon a set of gameplay mechnics, themes
-   Start reading documentation / tutorials on LibGDX
-   Assign peices of the project to various members
-  i.e. Quality Assurance Tester, Art/Sprites, Gameplay Mechanics, Data Persistance?

### Communcation
We all have different schedules. We can research how remote teams communicate to each other i.e. Gitter
-  Keith Harryman..My schedule is 1130-330 MWF and 1245-315 TTh. Please see MadMother, a free game in Google Play Store. I will try to post to my github as an example of the java and libgdx I used. One idea I've had is to build a simple Mine Dodge game.
